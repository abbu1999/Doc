		Team Work:

			 I actively contribute to the team's success by providing support and assistance to both Airtel India and Airtel Africa (Airtel Money) team members with any Linux and monitoring setup/tool-related issues. I consistently demonstrate sufficient knowledge of Linux and our monitoring tools, ensuring smooth operations and troubleshooting when needed.

			Additionally, I played a key role in server patching activities for both projects. In the Airtel India project, this was conducted collaboratively at the team level, while in the Airtel Africa project, I took the initiative to perform the patching independently during off-hours from 2:30 am to 10 am. These efforts highlight my dedication to teamwork and proactive problem-solving, contributing to the overall success of our projects

		Communication:

			Throughout the Airtel India project, I effectively managed the diverse requirements of Unoc and Postpaid clients, ensuring seamless collaboration among Network, Linux, Cyberark/Arcos, storage, and Resource Management teams. By initiating regular Zoom/Team calls and maintaining active email correspondence, I fostered an environment of proactive communication, facilitating swift problem-solving and resolution of technical challenges. Additionally, I actively engaged in client meetings and discussions, providing clarity on project progress and addressing any concerns promptly. My adept communication skills and dedication to transparent dialogue were integral in nurturing a cohesive team dynamic and driving successful outcomes across multifaceted project dimensions.

		Mentoring:

			In addition to my core responsibilities in the Airtel India and Airtel Africa projects, I actively engaged in mentoring activities within the team. Leveraging my 3 years of hands-on experience with Linux and monitoring tools such as Elastic, Logstash, Grafana, and Alerting Tools like syrn/watchman into my mentoring efforts. Drawing from this wealth of hands-on knowledge, I guided team members towards efficient utilization of these tools, optimizing workflows, and maximizing productivity.

		Common Professional Etiquette:

			In both the Airtel India and Airtel Africa projects, I upheld and demonstrated common professional etiquette in various aspects of my work. This included:

			1. Effective Communication: I maintained open and transparent communication channels with team members, clients, and stakeholders. I ensured clarity in all interactions and promptly addressed any queries or concerns, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.

			2. Respectful Collaboration: I valued the perspectives and contributions of all team members, fostering an inclusive environment where everyone felt heard and respected. I actively listened to others, acknowledged their input, and encouraged diverse viewpoints to drive innovation and problem-solving.

			3. Timely Responsiveness: I prioritized timely responses to emails, messages, and requests, demonstrating reliability and professionalism in my communication. This helped in facilitating smooth coordination and ensuring that project activities progressed without delays.

			4. Adaptability and Flexibility: I remained adaptable and flexible in navigating project challenges and changes. I approached unforeseen circumstances with a positive attitude, proactively seeking solutions and adjusting plans as needed to maintain project momentum.
